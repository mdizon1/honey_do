Feature: Reorder todo items
         In order to manage household chores
         As a manager of the household
         I want to be able to drag todo items to change their order

  #Scenario: Create todo item from blank list
  #  Given a household named "Tuttle" exists
  #  And a user exists with the email "foo@bar.com" and password "123456"
  #  And the user "foo@bar.com" belongs to the household "Tuttle"
  #  And there is a todo item titled "Take out the trash" which belongs to the household "Tuttle"
  #  And there is a todo item titled "Wash the dishes" which belongs to the household "Tuttle"
  #  And I visit the home page
  #  When I click the sign in link
  #  When I fill in "foo@bar.com" for "user_email"
  #  And I fill in "123456" for "user_password" 
  #  And I submit the "new_user" form
  #  # Logged in

  #  Then I should be signed in
  #  And the todo titled "Take out the trash" should appear above the todo titled "Wash the dishes"
  #  When I drag the todo titled "Take out the trash" over the todo titled "Wash the dishes"
  #  Then the todo titled "Wash the dishes" should appear above the todo titled "Take out the trash"
