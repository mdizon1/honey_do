* Purpose of this document
  Keep track of todo items for Honey Do development
* Current
** Test performance on mobile on a remote server
   Fire up the amazon ec2 dev machine, pull the code, run and try to use the app
   from my phone
** TODO Big lag between check todo and todo getting checked
   First let's see if there's a big delay between the actual touch and the
   action being triggered

   No big delay between when touch activated and when event fires nor when the
   action is dispatched.

   I believe the problem has to do with the entire list being rerendered when
   something is checked
** TODO Performance improvement attempt
*** TODO Make TodoListWrap pass down something that may be checked for equality
    Passing down an object which was instantiated with toJS() will always result in an inequality
    var foo = store.getIn(...)
    foo.toJS() === foo.toJS() is false
    ensure whatever I do pass down would evaluate to true if it hasn't changed.
*** TODO Change the way drag/drop works
    Rather than keep track of some new index or position, just keep track of the
    nearest neighbor. Then in TodoListWrap (or maybe even TodoList), render the
    placeholder next to it's neighbor. This way, the indices of the list don't
    have to update, only the position of the placeholder.
** TODO Mobile performance issues:
*** TODO Avoid toJS() in mapStateToProps
*** DONE Try having each todo item grab itself from store
    CLOSED: [2018-04-12 Thu 23:10]
    Rather than have todolist pass todos down to them, it just passes the todo
    id which then each todo item retrieves itself from storage Needs more
    restructuring, let's get rid of todos and shopping list as separate. Instead
    the current tab would set an additional filter value which grabs out only
    the relevant todos

    This wasn't the right course of action. It's possible to prevent each todo
    from rerendering without doing this. They should either use
    shouldComponentUpdate or just properly block out mapStateToProps..

** TODO Drag n drop still not accurate
   Heres what I did:
   Filter todos so only 4 or so appear
   Grab the lowest one
   Drag it to the #2 spot
   It appears in the #3 spot

   There's probably some quirks with redordering while the list is being
   filtered.  I think i'll have to revisit the reordering algorithm perhaps
   instead of places jumped, I go by adjacency. That is, when you drag
   something, it looks at the nearby ones and moves to the appropriate space
   next to them, reordering the rest.

   Server side, rather than do places jumped, pass in either the top neighbor or
   bottom neighbor (if you're at the top of the list, there'll only be a bottom
   neighbor). Then make the move accordingly

** TODO Upgrade immutable js
** TODO Ditch calls to bind(this)
** TODO Replace $.ajax with http.get and put etc
** TODO Error with todo reordering
   So there were a number of issues, both with my logic and with some disparity
   between the client and server. I've plugged all the problems but 1 remains:
   if a todo is at position 1, and the next todo is at position 3, using
   move_lower (acts as list) puts it at position 2 rather than actually moving
   it down the list. This is in contradiction to the documentation which says
   that case has been fixed.

** TODO Change the way sync works
*** TODO Change the way todos are stored
    Rather than two arrays, they shoudl be 2 objects where the keys are IDs
    And the order of the todos are dictated by the position value of each todo
*** TODO Sync reconciles what comes from server
    Rather than sync just replacing the state of the data, it'll only update the
    todos on the client which have changed, it'll also only add todos which are
    new. This is so that if the server sends data to the client which matches
    (nothing changed) then the client doesn't have to rerender at all

   decouple the API component which talks to the server with the pure javascript
   app interactivity. This way you could run a version of the app whicih doesn't
   talk to the server at all and has no persistent state (or maybe it does..)

*** TODO Drag takes 2 taps
    1 to activate the drag, 2nd to actually start dragging
    Test this on actual mobile device to see if it's just a simulator issue

    Yep, tested on mobile and there is a problem.

    Look into TodoItem which has todoSource which has the beginDrag function.
    Maybe there's something going on there when picking something up on touch.

    After putting in some debugs there is no indication that the problem is
    there. beginDrag and hover are both called when the initial touch+drag
    happens. However, after that it just stops without triggering any endDrag or
    drop. Once you again touch the placeholder, it continues triggering hovers

*** TODO Drag and drop performance is horrible, especially on mobile
    Having trouble pinning this down. Performance tool in chrome points to none
    of my code. Inserting a little timer debug statement seems to indicate there
    is a significant lag in TodoListWrap#handleTodoReorder callback, which gets
    called every time the todo item is being dragged to a new slot. However, the
    time delay happens after setState is called. Perhaps updating the state
    repeatedly is the wrong way to go about this?

    An alternative might be to create the draglayer card thingy, then attach
    that to a single todo. It would be drawn before that todo. So on update,
    rather than change state, only that particular todo and the next todo to
    acquire the placeholder would be updated.

*** TODO When you drag, don't scroll unless hitting the bottom/top of the viewport
** TODO Performance issues
*** TODO 2 taps to drag on mobile
*** TODO Slow drag performance esp on mobile
*** TODO Performance of sync operation
    The actual timing of sync isn't too important, the problem lies in that
    syncing blocks the app from doing anything else. Syncing should happen in
    the background. The app should maintain it's own state and then periodically
    sync/update it's state with that of the main server.

    My initial thought is that it basically keeps a log of all the operations
    that happen and if there is a conflict, then it'll have to be resolved by
    the person who modified it later. For example, if someone updates Todo 37
    and someone else updates it as well, upon sync, the second person's edit
    will be presented to them as a conflict resolution.

    Ultimately, a system like Git is the most solid, but way too heavyweight for
    such a simple todo app. The chances of there being a conflict are pretty
    small to begin with. The most likely scenario I can think of is let's say
    I'm going into BART and I'm doing some TODO management. I load the app, do
    some stuff at the station and then step into the train. Now I do some more
    work on hte train while I have no internet access. Once I get reception
    again, the sync operation is going to run and potentially there will be some
    conflicts. How will they get resolved?

    So, the possible solutions are as follows in order of complexity:
    + Git-like
    + Last-in rejected with conflict resolution step
    + First-in survivor
    + Last-in survivor

    No matter which one I go with, there are going to be a bunch of edge cases
    to contend with. What if userA deletes todo which is later edited by userB
    while they were offline?

    I think for the purposes of this app I should stick with the simplest
    solution which makes sense. I don't want a journaling-type system because
    that would involve making a "change" or "action" into a discrete object on
    it's own. The way I'd like to handle syncing would be to have all the app
    data loaded locally, and periodically a service worker would take what's in
    the store and present it to the server who would then incorporate the state
    of the store into the canonical state of the store (which is what's in the
    DB). The single sync operation should resolve all conflicts.

    The question then becomes: how to take state C (canonical state) and update
    it correctly when state A comes in? Then what happens to state B which is in
    flux and receives some update from the server with a new state C? I shall
    need to think on this problem some first

*** TODO TodosController#index is slow
** TODO Tags can have icons or avatars (not sure which yet, probably both)
** TODO Get tests working
   At least some basic workflow like cucumber/selenium can run and look at the
   starting page

   Where I left off, I was attempting to get PhantomJS/poltergeist working
   within the cucumber container. I got stuck yak shaving all day so screw that.
   Even downloading phantom js was problematic. It worked fine the first 2 or 3
   times now it just get's stuck in a 302 loop and bails out during the wget of
   the zip file. WTF???
** TODO :design: Make tags clearer/more visible
   Right now, they show above the title when you're editing a todo but it's not
   very clear what they are. Even I was confused after coming back to the app
   after a while. They should also be shown on the top level list without having
   to expand the edit modal. There probably won't be space on a phone but it
   could show conditionally if the window/device is wide enough.
** TODO :bug: If search/filter todo, then edit todo, then dismiss modal, it stops filtering but the search field doesn't clear
   I think it has to do with the way the TodoList is rerendered when the UI
   state changes. So the UI state changes causing a rerender up in the todo
   list, but the search/filter only happens when the search field changes.
   Either make the filtering happen intrinsically based on whatever value is in
   the search field, or clear the filter field when the modal goes away or on
   any rerender up the tree
** TODO Add an x button to the search/filter field to easily clear it.
   Tried doing this before but was having difficulty wrangling material ui to
   give the result I want. The spec for material ui specifies that X buttons in
   fields should live WITHIN the field. However, there is no built in mechanism
   to do so with <TextField> in the react lib. I figured I could mimic that
   behavior by adding it as a child component but that prevented me from
   clicking on the TextField at all.

    CLOSED: [2018-04-04 Wed 10:27]
    2 times it's called with empty todos

    Ok, looks like it's getting called once for each tab

    I think there's a problem with the way I'm handling rendering of each of the
    tabs. Rather than have stuff in both tabs, maybe it should only render
    whichever tab is active. The other tab goes away when switched off of.

    Not sure why it's triggering twice either way. 4 times, twice for each tab.
    Seems like it fires on todo click either way.  

    Ohhhh! got it! Since it triggers on every action, onTodoClick fires one
    action completeTodoRequest then the async action for completeTodoSuccess.

** DONE Separate syncing from client
   CLOSED: [2018-04-04 Wed 04:45]
   This is bringing me back to the syncing concept. Thinking about it freshly
   again, I think one possibility is to have the concept of "commands" or api
   calls go into a buffer which empties out on sync. So if you create 3 todo's,
   move 2 todo's, edit 1 todo, and delete a todo, then those actions get saved
   in a command buffer. When a sync is triggered, those commands get flushed to
   the server which then resolves them based on whatever state is currently
   canonical. So syncing happens asynchronously (doesn't happen on each action)
   and the state of the app is completely contained within the client. When the
   sync happens, then the app is refreshed and whatever status changes come down
   from upstream (server side) will be displayed to the user. Ultimately a
   service worker should handle the syncing but even without that I can just
   mock it by having the sync happen at some arbitrary interval

   Looks like perhaps I've been using redux wrong(?) Rather than try to cleverly
   organize things to attempt to prevent cascading rerenders, I guess you're
   just supposed to subscribe things to the store as needed and redux/react
   should just do the right thing. And if not, then use redux-batched-updates
   which should supposedly handle it.

   So step 1, stop using x.state and anything that depends on state should
   instead subscribe to the store. Otherwise, things just get rendered based on
   their props(?).  Do this, then see how the performance looks

   After working on the redux refactor a bit as described it doesn't seem like
   that is the problem. That still might be a path to fix some things but either
   way, this task I believe is more necessary. In order to make this a
   progressive web app, I'll need to handle the syncing issue and I think this
   is the way to do it.

    CLOSED: [2017-09-07 Thu 18:53]
